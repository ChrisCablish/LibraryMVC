Project: Library Management System

Setup:
Create a Spring Boot application with Thymeleaf, Spring Web, and other necessary dependencies.

Entities:
Book: Should have an ID, title, author, ISBN, and a borrowed status.
Borrower: Should have an ID, name, and a list of borrowed books.

Features:

Add a Book:
Create a form where users can add a new book with its title, author, and ISBN. Use
@ModelAttribute for binding the form data to a Book object.

List All Books:
Display a table of all books in the system. Next to each book, there should be an "Edit" and
"Borrow" link/button.

Edit a Book:
When users click on the "Edit" link/button next to a book, they should be taken to an edit form
populated with that book's data. Use th:value to populate the form fields and @RequestParam to
fetch the book ID from the URL. Also, use @ModelAttribute to bind the updated data and save
changes.

Borrow a Book:
When users click on the "Borrow" link/button, they should be taken to a new form where they
can input their name to borrow the book. Use @ModelAttribute to bind the form data to a
Borrower object and update the book's status.

Return a Book:
On the list of all books, if a book is borrowed, display the borrower's name and a "Return"
link/button next to it. When clicked, the book should be returned (i.e., its borrowed status
should be updated).

List All Borrowers:
Display a list of all borrowers and the books they've borrowed.

Bonus (if you're up for it):
Implement search functionality where users can search for books by title or author.
Implement validation to ensure ISBN is unique.

Remember:
Use th:action in your forms to specify where the form data should be sent.
Use both GET (for displaying forms and lists) and POST (for form submissions) requests in your
controller.
Start by setting up your project, creating your entities, and then step by step implement each
feature. This project encompasses the areas you wanted to focus on and should provide a
comprehensive practice. Good luck, and I'm here to help along the way!
